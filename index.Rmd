## Introduction
This project aims to answer how inflation is tied to an economy and the economic growth, and how one may combat inflation.

We currently live in a special time in history. While we are still dealing with an ongoing global pandemic,
the economy is also faced with high inflation. High inflation often leads to higher cost of living and decreased
living standard. The goal of this project is to analyze the effect of inflation on the economy. 
In the first part (midterm project), we will examine past inflation data and various economic metrics; this includes but not limited to inflation's effect on cost of living and different assets. 

Therefore, the main question we aim to answer are the following

1. How does inflation affect the overall economy and economic growth (e.g. GDP)?
2. How does inflation affect the standard of living i.e. CPI?
3. How are different assets affected by inflation (e.g. real estate, stocks)
4. How can one protect themselves from inflation by constructing a portfolio of assets?
   This looks at broader market in terms of different industrial sectors (in Part 2 of Project)
